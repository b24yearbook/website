# website
Official site of the PSHS-MC 2024 Yearbook.

## Developer's Notes:
- Use snake case for file naming, camel case for the actual programs. Or, discuss if we should do only camel case/only snake case.
- Always check [WEBSITE SPREADSHEET / PSEU-WHITEBOARD](<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15CqxZokV28Gtr6xROZcEN1DDmZWcwRz04KROE5VyMsQ/edit?usp=sharing>)!

## Minimum Required:
- Login Page fs
  - Messages and Preface of the yearbook  <-- maybe not the messages? I feel like that should be private to our batch.
- idk check the table of contents (cto: neche tud)
![Layout unit's content](./readme%20files/layout_units_progress.png)
- After Login Page, maybe the homepage is same thing (left side preface right side login) but instead of the login div, it's replaced with a "Meet the Graduates!" div which leads to the graduates.html
- check the [layouts](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFvnqW2RhA/zQkwD2JO3tRthdFrfztB1w/edit)
