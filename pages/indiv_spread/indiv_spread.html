        We hope more people get to see everything that is truly good in Lance, not just the surface level things or the things he does for them. Although he’s a good friend—and that’s a part of who someone is—it’s not just the way he acts towards people that should be loved by those he cares for. He does his best for others, but he’s also passionate about his hobbies and puts effort into all the things he wants to do without letting academic or social pressures crush him—just because he's better at dealing with them than some people doesn’t mean it’s just as easy for him—and for that we’re happy for him. His growth these past few years was impressive, we don’t know anyone else who’s done that. He’s always been a good person, but he wasn’t always so honest to himself and we can’t explain how proud and thankful we are that he seems much happier and freer now without letting his drive for life and his passion projects go. We’re glad he got here. It’s always enough where he is, but we know he’ll want to keep walking forward.

        Lance is a cool guy. He likes doing art, coding, and making all sorts of things, and oh boy, does that guy make! From several random projects to his child and baby video game, he makes a lot, including some cute crochets! But he also desires meaning in every little creation, all of them greatly thought-provoking. He has a vivid imagination which often makes his output unique and beautiful, and it is also why he ends up joining a lot of projects with his peers. His passion and dedication to the things he likes is not to be underestimated. Snagging a spot in the Director’s List twice in each quarter for the past 21 years and having won the Nobel Peace Prize in Computerography, he has truly worked hard for all the skills he has and it shines most evidently in everything he draws, types, and writes. His gamer brain is huge, and his joker spleen, which is very serious, is similarly swollen from the insane amounts of comedy fluid inside. He’s fun to hang out with and is usually down for some shenanigans, primarily because of his second spleen—his compassion and friendship spleen. He shall forever live on in our hearts—our dangerously enlarged hearts. Live, laugh, Libatique.
