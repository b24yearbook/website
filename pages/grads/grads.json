He can disappear for days on end, but we\u2019re glad he takes time to take care of himself. We tend to be selfish when dealing with Ben, but it's because we trust him to the point we show our worst sides. There's no one else who has understood us as he did. All these years, since the first day of seventh grade, he knew our worst and best moments and the emotions we felt through all of them. However, he's not only the best sibling we could ever ask for but also one of the best people in this world. Though some things concern me, his lack of an attention span, his absolute sabog and out of context quotes, his periods of mindlessly scribbling in his journal to untangle his thoughts, and his love of the stars and the night sky, are all so lovable. It\u2019s great how much he cares for his family and friends even when things get complicated and heavy, such as giving his thoughtful little gifts or the way he slumps into our arms for a hug when he's had a tiring day. It makes you want to cheer him on when he attempts not to stress out over things out of his control and keeps on trying despite the \u201cbrainworms.\u201d It\u2019s endearing how much effort he puts into the subjects he loves and how he has no qualms sacrificing his grades in other ones; it is worrying, but priorities that make him happy are admirable. We hope in his life that he\u2019ll always keep making his silly Halloween costumes and Tech standee shoes. He\u2019s grown so much, and while sometimes we miss the cute old him, we\u2019re thankful for his (not really) responsible current self. We hope to see him achieve all of his dreams. By the way, he\u2019s a nerd, but we love him!"]

She truly has the power to change not only her friends but also the world. Athena may have her own basement (this is an inside joke in Computron, don\u2019t worry), but overall, she is a good and well-raised person. She is the best club president and the best Athena, whom many aspire to be at least half as good as.

People know her and gravitate to her for her quiet demeanor, but as always, there is much more to her than her quietness. She is incredibly funny; she could keep a joke running with you forever and never tire of it. Like her namesake, Athena is also a bright mind of sharp wit, the pessimist who brings out the optimist, and the girl who fell out of the sky. Finally, Athena is the embodiment of kindness and understanding; she is the warmth of a hearth, a place to relax your weary bones and shed your layers without fear of judgment. Athena\u2019s presence means comfort and acceptance. There are simply not enough words to paint what it\u2019s like in her company. No matter how much you may push and prod, Athena is a person who will open her arms when you ask for a hug. She has won all our hearts, a true victory from the goddess of war.

It wasn\u2019t that he was never upset about anything but that he could quickly bounce back from his problems and return to his cheerful self.\r\n\r\nI also observed that he is a very talented person, especially with regards to his voice. His resounding voice catches attention during any performance, whether it be speech or song. I often enjoyed listening to his impromptu classroom concerts, and I truly admired the confidence he had in his abilities.\r\n\r\nThough I held and still hold much appreciation for his talents, what my shy, seventh grade self admired most about him was that he always had the courage to express his opinions. He was open with others when I was too timid to be, so I sincerely wished I could be more like him. He was an inspiration in my own self-improvement throughout the years, and I am eternally grateful I met him.\r\n\r\nLike everyone else, RD also went through his fair share of troubles in these six years of high school. Even so, he persevered through them all and got to where he is now, and I am proud of how far he has come. Even so, I am more proud of the things that never changed about him; RD in Grade 12 has grown a lot from his Grade 7 self, but his comforting kindness and determination to help remained."]

"Writeups": ["A friendship with Pia is as pretty as her smile. Whenever she talks about her passions, her eyes light up with excitement, revealing a smile so warm and so contagious. She's incredibly pretty in a way that many are surprised she isn't in a relationship yet. She's someone who's always trying to be the best version of herself, whether it be through her dancing or her efforts to be early. Although she may be seen as shy and timid from the outside, her personality completely contradicts it, exhibiting fiery, outspoken, and witty traits. When she is with friends, her booming voice can be heard from the other tables. Her friendship is the kind that isn\u2019t there just for the pretty parts of life; Pia will be there for you during the ugly and bad times, and she will be cheering you on when you\u2019re at your highest. Pia is the person many would turn to when they need someone to empathize with their problems or need someone to just talk to. Having Pia as a friend is an invaluable treasure. Once you have her in your life, you will never go back.", "Pia is a force to be reckoned with. Her captivating aura easily exudes a warm and delightful energy with her presence. With her down-to-earth demeanor, she\u2019s able to seamlessly connect with others through the positivity she radiates. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that the atmosphere of the room brightens up when she enters. As Taylor Swift would say, she\u2019s got a smile that could light up this whole town. She makes sure everyone feels seen and understood, turning even small talk into enjoyable moments of laughter. Moreover, she is extremely kind and reliable, and it\u2019s so easy to just be yourself when you're around her. She\u2019s the sweetest and most precious friend that one could ever ask for. In the face of challenges, her stern nature emerges. She does her best in tackling adversities with her firm resolve. Pia's bangs aren't just strands of hair; they're strands of discipline and confidence. Pia Basas is one of a kind, so special in her own way, and words aren\u2019t enough to describe how lovable she is. All of her traits and characteristics make her a gorgeous, gorgeous girl with a lot of love to give and a smile worthy of every camera in the world."]

Sometimes, we wonder how Jez kept track of so much, but considering how we got into Project Sekai and Identity V because of it, there\u2019s no doubt of the devotion Jez can and does hold. It isn\u2019t limited to hobbies though. We\u2019ve seen the strong sense of justice and principles Jez holds, and it would be a lie to say that we haven\u2019t felt admiration towards her. To firmly stand one\u2019s ground is already hard in itself, but to fight for it with eloquence, reason, and empathy is a different feat, one that she does exceptionally well.\r\nWe\u2019re not sure if Jez is aware, but being inspiring comes naturally to her. In the way she presents herself, thinks, and feels, we\u2019ve both unknowingly taken bits and pieces of them into our own patterns. Jez holds a special kind of love that urges us to simply become better\u2014in more ways than one. It\u2019s in this we find a different type of comfort with her. In the simple things we laugh, hug, and cuss each other out\u2014but it\u2019s never without endearment.\r\nSimply put, Jez truly is someone remarkably irreplaceable in our lives. Each to our own, we both hold memories with her that permanently shaped who we are for the better. So, for so long as we can, we will continue to hold onto and make new memories, through the better and worse, to continue giving back the same joys Jez has given us.\r\nAfter all, as Miku once said, \u201cee oo ee oo.\u201d"]

He knew it would be hard to live on his own for a while, but at a tender age of 12, he did.

Just like any variable that he solves, he treated his communication hiccup as a learning opportunity where he can grow. Eventually, he learned to share more of his thoughts and feelings with others. It is his consistent effort to strive for greatness and push the boundaries of what he could achieve that drives his academic success in Pisay. There is no doubt that he will continue to conquer the world of numbers, logic, and analysis.

He is strong-willed and fierce, a leader driven by his burning passion and determination to take on all his responsibilities. Karl is an inspiration in making life fulfilling. He pours his heart into everything he does\u2014fulfilling his tasks flawlessly, even doing a lot more than what is being asked. He is also extremely talented. Where else would you find someone who manages to excel in everything wherever you take him? On top of that, he\u2019s an amazing friend. Sure, sometimes he\u2019s crazy and says or does the most unserious and questionable things, but he\u2019s also a sweet, loving, and dependable friend who will always be there for the people he cares about. His endearingly unique and complex personality is something you\u2019ll never forget. He is our incredibly talented show-stopping brilliant funny amazing Student Council President, and he truly is one of a kind.

However, for us, there is more to him than simply being a leader; Karl is a friend. Despite his very intimidating aura, Karl has this side that he only shows to his closest friends. He has a lively personality and an exceptional sense of humor that you would only understand if you have the same crests and troughs as him. Karl would be that friend\u2014the one who will always give extra effort just to make sure that you will have a smile on your face even during the darkest days of your life. He is also willing to share his past experiences (even traumas) if it means that you will have a person you can relate to. Karl Bueser\u2014a leader, a dancer, an achiever, and most importantly, a friend\u2014is a name that would forever be engraved in the history of Pisay."]

Whether you\u2019d be talking to him about the most mundane things, updating each other regarding your love lives, sharing with him chika that you\u2019ve heard, or even when revealing to him the most hidden thoughts that you have, with Kenaz, any conversation is guaranteed to be a great moment. Hanging out with him fills the air with melodies of laughter and leisure. Determination, gentleness, and confidence always emanate from him. Overall, he\u2019s just the chillest and coolest friend ever."]

She's like a teddy bear, a strong, independent, cutely sassy, loveable, and honestly admirable one. And also like teddy bears, she\u2019s a really great friend. If being a friend were some sort of trade to master, she\u2019d be the grand supreme mega over-overlord of it, and as ridiculous as that sounds, not one word suffices to encompass exactly how good of a friend she is. If you're lucky enough to be Lily's friend, know that you\u2019ve won in life because she will love you and stay with you through thick and thin. Being so down-to-earth, she\u2019ll pull you back down if she finds you flying too close to the sun. She\u2019ll flash that warm smile of hers every so often and ask you how you are or send a message at random just to check up on you. She is great at listening to things she may not even agree with; however, she may also change your paradigm on life. Although she may stumble and fall along the path we call life, just as Lily is always here by our side, we will be to her \u201cfather, mother, and brother\u201d\u2014her family.", "Lily is the designated grandmother of the friend group, and we don\u2019t mean that anywhere near derogatorily. Humble, despite her vast knowledge, she quite literally tops every single Kahoot game out there. She is very outgoing and loves sharing her thoughts and experiences with other people, such as her hobbies and games (MHR, writing, Sky, and many others). Everything about her is authentic: her niche interests, her writing style, and her genuine care for people. She's the reason we remained sane throughout the pandemic, thanks to her constant encouragement and unending support. After all these years that we have been together, we are beyond grateful that she has stuck with us and that we can call her one of our closest friends."]

He can burden you by sharing his romantic fantasies, though. He seems mature, humble, and unproblematic, and in unexpected ways, he sometimes is. He also can\u2019t survive a single group work with his friends because he usually just goes along with what his friends do. In other words, he\u2019s easy to peer pressure (unless it\u2019s between you and Physics). One time, he couldn\u2019t even get out of a conversation with a very enthusiastic lower year student about modular arithmetic, and he even got into the topic after a bit. He still doesn\u2019t know who he was talking to.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s unafraid to show his friends his weaknesses, but you\u2019ll see he often admits to having self-conscious moments and realize he simply chooses to trust others. He\u2019ll be a baby sometimes and send songs about never opening up or being cold due to past heartbreak, but in truth, he\u2019s a simple and honest guy, and that\u2019s such a rare thing that it warms you to see it. He\u2019s a massive fan of terrible jokes and memes, but he\u2019s honest about it, and that adds to his charm. He is relatable and feels like the only person who you\u2019ll easily understand, but then he rambles about his favorite theories in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. He\u2019s quirky yet easy to talk to. We like the way he lives his life; he naturally encourages people to truly love studying whether it be his own interests or not. He\u2019s a great person to be changed by, but he\u2019ll hardly notice it, as he tries not to inconvenience people, especially his friends. Harold goes about his quiet life casually winning international competitions, rambling about theoretical physics, and sending you his life realizations (and some cute cat videos, too) at 3 AM while listening to a Taylor Swift song on loop."]

Getting accepted into PHSA for Creative Writing further cemented her hopes. Consequently, when Pisay did call to inform about an open slot, her pre-written plans shook. She thought, \u201cWhat now? Is this a sign?\u201d A piece of advice from Sir Dalisay stuck with her, going along the lines of: \u201cDon\u2019t go to a writing school because writing might be the only thing you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d Hence, to explore possibilities and become an all-rounder ace, she chose Pisay for the plot.

Having survived through all six seasons of painful but fulfilling character development, she is just happy that she stuck around \u2018til the end.

When you\u2019re upset, down, or conflicted with just about anything, you can always expect to get the most real advice from her without a hint of bias. Arwen is the most reliable, patient, and understanding human in the world. She is the definition of a strong, independent woman. Once you get to know her a bit more, you\u2019ll realize just how maturely and impressively she\u2019s able to navigate everything in her life. A fur mom to her golden retriever babies, her compassion and loving heart shine through in everything she does. Her only kryptonite in this world is her love for tall, chinito, suplado, bassist Atentistas with above-average hands. Despite this, Arwen will always find a way to accomplish all of her goals in life, unmistakably earning her title as a superwoman, just like her mother.", "At first glance, you would get the impression that Arwen is shy. But when you actually get to know her, she\u2019s really shy, but she\u2019s the shy, golden retriever type that likes coffee (white chocolate mocha, no whipped cream, non-fat milk, less ice, grande), OPM, guitar, and tall cute Chinese guys with glasses na suplado at siya lang \u2018yung pinapansin. She\u2019s the type of person you will tell your whole life story to without any judgment. She\u2019s one of the most understanding and caring people one can ever meet. Despite being quiet, she is easy to approach and get along with. Once you become close enough, you\u2019ll see the fun and talkative side of her that you\u2019d miss if you don\u2019t talk for just a day; her presence is one you would look forward to seeing every day, and that\u2019s more than enough to brighten your mood and sustain you through hard times. She\u2019s that friend you\u2019d go to whenever you have to rant about something or just release every negative thought in your head, and she\u2019ll listen attentively to every single word you\u2019ll say. It is no surprise that Arwen\u2019s friends will be there for her no matter what, like she always does for them. A friendship with Arwen is one that feels like family."]

For example, if you see a fabled \u201cstressed, depressed, but still well-dressed\u201d slogan in the wild, you can rest easy knowing that it, too, is a Nina Corpuz. In fact, we have a friend named Nina Corpuz who was trying to look for her favorite animal, but her fly was open. Nina is one of the best, kindest, and most loyal friends you could ever have. She\u2019ll give you a hug when she notices something\u2019s wrong despite you saying you\u2019re alright, but she\u2019ll also bully you relentlessly in the most affectionate way ever. Sometimes, it\u2019s hard to remember that she\u2019s only an aspiring psychologist and not a licensed one yet, given how she handles her friends\u2019 vents and breakdowns. She employs several novel therapy techniques, such as staring at you incredulously when you excuse someone\u2019s very not alright actions towards you, or saying \u201cgirliepop\u201d in the most concerned voice when you spontaneously scream.\r\n\r\nThere are a myriad of things that make her one of the easiest people to befriend and love: her boldness with her iconic winged eyeliner, pink jacket, and butterfly jewelry; her talents of photography, leadership, and juggling her many orgs and extracurriculars; and her humor, which she insists gets worse and worse everyday. Above all is her whole-hearted acceptance for other people, no matter their quirks or flaws. It is the way she personifies kindness that makes her a lifeline to so many of her friends. It is the way she so casually gives out hugs that makes her such a warm safe space. It is the way she loves so openly, when love is the purest thing anybody can offer to others.\r\n\r\nShe may doubt herself, but we\u2019ll believe in her so aggressively she starts to too. Nina has an unparalleled power that shows beyond her academic achievements, extracurriculars, and contributions to organizations; it\u2019s the power to love, and she has slowly but surely been learning to show that power to herself too. That is, sincerely, an inspiration. So, to our queen of hearts, we are always proud of you!"]

So, at first glance, you\u2019d probably think that he\u2019s quiet and that he\u2019d never talk to you, but when he does, you\u2019ll realize what you\u2019ve been missing out on in life. Even with his occasional questionable sense of humor, he\u2019s someone you can easily get along with. There are things he doesn\u2019t take too seriously, like league drafts and frisbee throws. However, when he does take them seriously, his impeccable skills are honestly impressive. Sometimes, he\u2019s just quietly playing mobile games somewhere, but then, the next thing you hear about him is his participation in three separate contests. He is truly fearless and unpredictable, and we love him because of that. His commitment to everything he does is remarkable, from working tirelessly on his academics, whether it is his scale model for Tech or preparing microwaved chicken for Research, to his three roles as vocalist, cajonist, and kazooist in his band, The Throwers, or even just remixing and creating the silliest songs and videos and posting them online. Nonetheless, one of the two most important commitments of his is his commitment to wafer sticks Super Stix. One time, for a week, he just kept bringing a pack of Super Stix or Stick-O to school, and every pack would be a new one, even his Cchristmas exchange gift was six packs of Super Stix. The other important commitment of his is his commitment to K-Drama. Johan will always find a way to not be unable to watch K-Drama. Play League TFT? He will run it in split screen so he can watch on the other half. Sleepover? Sure, but he will not sleep at all until he gets his daily dose of K-Drama.\r\n\r\nJohan\u2019s patience and humor make him a true friend, so once you get close and gain his trust, make sure you cherish it. His wisdom, intelligence, and patience make him one of the best persons to approach for inquiries. He does not stop until you get whatever lesson you need and makes sure he teaches you, even if it\u2019s the basics. Moreover, his goofy ideas will crack you up and the finished products will make you laugh even harder. His great responsibility and his warm personality is why we joke that even at just 17 years old, Johan is already a father of 19.\r\n"]

He always tries to prove that he is \u201cThe GOAT\u201d at basketball or in gaming, and sometimes takes the L, but he just brushes it off and laughs. That\u2019s what makes him amazing; bro can take hits and decide to just stand back up and do it all over again until he succeeds. No hard feelings, no nothing\u2014he just grinds until he becomes the best, and he does show promise of being the best in anything he does. He calls himself the young Jokic and the joker. Although probably not backed by his basketball skills, his sense of humor is always on-point. He somehow manages to find the most random topics and makes it humorous with his contagious laughter and excellent delivery. He spilled his siomai on himself during Grade 7 and casually said \u201cI meant to do that.\u201d He would say \u201cSalvador Tomas Danilo\u201d and have everyone laughing non-stop.\r\n\r\nBehind his sense of humor is his intelligence. He is simultaneously the crudest and friendliest person you could meet. He is both your popular cool kid and history nerd. Though it may not be obvious at first because his sense of humor masks it, you can always have a meaningful and engaging discussion with him when it comes to world events. If you ignore his banter and jokes, Miguel is one of the biggest nerds you'll see. He trades stocks, memorizes history, plays video games, and loves to read books. It is an actual talent that someone is able to combine all of these hobbies together and become one of the most enjoyable people you'll ever meet. He\u2019s not afraid to voice out his thoughts, so you don\u2019t need to figure out what his motives are. He\u2019s straightforward, which is another one of his strong points that makes him a fun-to-be-with person because you can just be yourself around him.\r\n\r\nMiguel never fails to make anyone laugh, and he\u2019s one of the most confident people we\u2019re glad to have befriended. This guy is our inspiration to become more confident and humorous individuals ourselves. Even if it didn\u2019t work 100% of the time, it still worked nonetheless."]

His inclination for writing is just one of his many notable qualities. When thinking of Raph, a Pinterest board of light academia pictures comes to mind; in other words, he is academic, aesthetic, altruistic, and all-around just amazing. His expert word usage extends beyond writing, as he is also able to effectively communicate with others in the best way possible. As a friend, he is someone who is always all ears in any type of conversation, whether it be light or serious, and he also gives great advice when needed. He knows when to joke around and have fun, but he also knows when to be serious and to correct you if you are on the wrong track. When you need someone to help you out, he is always there to lend a helping hand even when he himself is busy. Partner these traits with his charismatic personality and you get someone who not only can lighten up the atmosphere of any room he walks into but also a dependable friend and an overall positive influence on the people he interacts with."]

He's always down to listen to you, showing great enthusiasm in the conversation, be it about interests, troubles, or high points in your life. He'll always match your vibe so you know that with him, you don't have to be afraid of being judged. If you worry about being cringey, he's the person who will readily be cringey with you. And before you know it, you\u2019ve been talking with him for hours. He might not always check up on you, but do know that he\u2019ll always be there to listen to you if you need someone to talk to. That\u2019s what makes him such a good friend, and anyone should consider themselves lucky to be his friend. If you achieve anything, no matter how small, know that he\u2019ll be jumping with pride with the biggest grin on his face just for you, and you\u2019ll wonder what it was you did to deserve that\u2014to deserve him. He\u2019s probably one of the most kind-hearted and interesting people you could ever meet. It\u2019s always a crazy time with him, but in a good way, and you won\u2019t regret a single second."]

You can\u2019t even get mad at him; he\u2019s hilarious enough to always lighten the mood. Whenever he\u2019s around, it\u2019s only a matter of time before you burst into laughter because of him. Whatever he may be up to, his dedication and commitment as a friend and a student is felt by those around. His academic strengths are always highlighted especially in Physics, where his participation in competitions prove just how amazing he truly is. In addition, his immense knowledge and advanced understanding of the world around us is something only most of us can dream of. In the topics he\u2019s passionate about learning (philosophy and stoicism), his advanced intellect and outstanding insight come out.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you can also learn so much from how he navigates life. He has an extraordinary grasp on his ideals and beliefs that allow him to become an extremely wise man. There are moments where he gives you advice that you didn\u2019t even know you needed. Whatever troubles you might have, he cheers you up with his silliness (after giving the most serious and life-changing advice you\u2019d hear). The way he balances his goofy habits and his thoughtful and knowledgeable advice is why this guy is the best person to talk to when you have a problem. He\u2019s never going to leave your side when you need him most, and he is someone that is always willing to go lengths for the people he cares most about. His authenticity is regularly needed in the world, and you\u2019d be extremely lucky to be a listener to his midnight talks about life or  interact with him in debates about any topic you could think of. In the world where we\u2019ve become more infatuated with our phones and social media, we all need an Axel to remind us of what should truly matter, and that\u2019s why he is definitely one of the most important people to keep in all of our lives."]

Throughout her stay in Pisay, she has reached great heights and impressed us all. She is a very hardworking and dependable student, managing to juggle multiple extracurricular activities while still staying on top of her requirements. Zsaneah has music in her heart and soul. She has a distinct dedication to it, from her proficiency with the instruments she plays, to her leadership of the music club Cuerdas Agham, to the sheer electrifying energy of her on stage whenever she performs with her band Now You\u2019re Mine. Even before being president of Cuerdas Agham and eventually starting her own band, she was part of SaMaPi, performing banger after banger for all the activities and fundraisers held by the club. Inseparable from her love for music is her love for games. She is a fan of games such as Outer Wilds and the Nier series, and she would often learn various songs from their OSTs. This passion has driven her to explore many hobbies, many of which have been a great source of joy. One day, she hopes that she will be able to develop games that will impact others the same way games have impacted her life. She is also part of a well-known and well-loved comedy trio called \u201cThe Nuggets,\u201d (in)famous for suddenly breaking into a flawlessly synchronized dance. The Nuggets, which consists of herself, Ram Oronce, and Angelo Lingal, have been a tightly knit group since Grade 7. Rarely do you ever see a friend group that has remained close despite all the struggles a six-year stay in Pisay can bring, so their friendship is beyond inspiring. To Zsaneah, as you have been officially declared the shortest in Batch 2024, we hope you continue to grow\u2014as a person, not just in height! Know that you have come so far in ways that truly cannot be described in words and that all your friends and peers are proud of you."]

As years go by, I discovered na medyo magaling din ako sa ibang STEM subjects like Physics and Computer Science. This enabled me to help others pass their quizzes and exams. Apart from this, I also started casually listening to Pop, K-Pop, and OPM songs every day on Spotify. From that, na-discover ko yung favorite music artists ko, including Taylor Swift, Blackpink, and Seventeen. I also discovered the songs that my friends love.

She\u2019s also one of the kindest people we have ever met, to the point where even when she\u2019s mad or irritated, she still seems so soft and cute.\r\n\r\nShe is your ride or die, both in the typical meaning of the phrase and in the sense that you either both die now metaphorically via collective spontaneous combustion or ride out the strange messed up journey of life.

Her clear skin, lovely makeup, and impeccable taste in fashion are some of the many reasons why she attracts so many admirers. Some might call her a \u201ccampus baddie\u201d or even a \u201cmain slayer.\u201d She\u2019s also intelligent, diligent, consistent, hard-working, and responsible\u2014a strong leader who advocates for the betterment of the batch. It\u2019s a wonder how she can hold so many responsibilities while maintaining their D.L. status. She can truly do it all.\r\n\r\nThese qualities may mislead others to find her intimidating. However, once you get to know her, you\u2019ll learn about her quirks: slapping others from laughter, making weird voices, exchanging funny faces, and much more. She\u2019s an avid reader who shares many similarities with the brave, bright, and independent Belle from Beauty and the Beast. She is endearingly conyo and maarte, a city girl who knows what she wants, works hard for it, and gets it. She may be shy at first, but once she gets going, she won\u2019t stop talking. However, among all of these traits, the most memorable one is her sincerity in her friendships. Although she\u2019s bad at keeping a straight face, she tries her best to keep your secrets. She supports and cares for you in whatever way she can. In troubling times, she will be by your side, physically and emotionally, rain or shine. Above all, she is beautiful inside and out, graceful one moment and silly the next, and a really cherished friend."]

I did not know any of my classmates, and, as an introvert, I found it difficult to talk to them. Thus, the First Quarter of Grade 7 was one of the hardest Pisay times for me. Fortunately, my passion for STEM, especially Mathematics, motivated me to work hard, allowing me to be on the Director\u2019s List.\r\nGrade 8 was another interesting year for me. While I was getting used to life in PSHS, long-term problems started to arise. The first problem was my inability to focus on activities apart from academics. The only extracurricular activity I joined was the Mathematics Training Program (MTP). Another problem I faced was that I found it hard to interact with other students. I was by myself most of the time\u2014when studying, eating, or even playing. This made it difficult for me to collaborate in a group. To make matters worse, the COVID-19 Pandemic forced everyone to stay home and continue education through online learning. However, I must admit that I found it enjoyable because I did not have to travel, lending me more time to study, browse the Internet, and play video games. I was happy about my performance in class despite the lockdown.\r\nBy Grade 11, we were back to face-to-face classes, albeit wearing a mask. Surprisingly, even though topics became advanced, academics felt more lenient because there were only seven subjects, giving me more free time in school. This allowed me to join a club. I attended every meeting and participated in activities, thus realizing the importance of my extracurricular life. Grade 11 ended up being one of my best years in PSHS because the varied tasks I engaged in added color to my high school experience.\r\nOver the last five years, I have learned a great deal as a Pisay student. My most important realization is that a successful person maintains a well-balanced life. I had become so focused on academics that I neglected my social life. This realization has changed my perspective on life. For this, I am grateful to PSHS for providing me with avenues to rethink my direction toward the future."]

The loudest people in class next to the quietest person in the batch is a recipe for disaster. Luckily, in our first interactions, we had a simple solution to become friends: be goofy. For one, she had to repeatedly pick up a pen that we dropped over and over. For the other, she quietly scolded one of us for using their phone during Chem. We realized that although quiet, she was anything but timid with her friends. Don\u2019t let her timidness fool you. Her tired eyes hide intense introspection; the Kuromi merch marks a sharp tongue that stands up to any loudmouth (i.e. shutting us up as we laugh at crude jokes in class). In getting to know her more, though, the funny moments stand out amidst her standoffish demeanor, like when she screams song lyrics at a concert, berates her latest anime obsession, or cries over an unexpected gift (sorry, amin).

She\u2019s that one person to whom you can express all your thoughts, emotions, and opinions, and she will never look at you with judgment. The way she gives meaningful advice, unwavering support, and honesty, makes her a true keeper."]

It doesn\u2019t matter what time of the year it is\u2014to her, every day is your birthday. While this may just be a joke, if you squint at it a bit, it\u2019s actually true! Birthdays are special days, ones where you celebrate having lived another year. Lauren is the type of person who celebrates the fact that you survive daily, as she knows that getting through each day can be a struggle. However, this explanation doesn\u2019t account for how she also greets people with \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d or other holiday greetings. What does explain it is the fact that Lauren makes every day special. Lauren is many things: a writer, an artist, a musician, an aspiring wildlife biologist, a certified clown, and most of all: a best friend. With her jokes and weird girl behavior, she has brightened up our lives as we laugh and let ourselves be weird alongside her. Even during the pandemic, her infectiously strange humor reached her many friends, driving them insane in the best ways possible. She has also been an invaluable support pillar for many of us, always making a point of being there for her friends. She\u2019s soothed us through many a breakdown and joined us as we raged about the many struggles and injustices we have faced over the years. With Lauren by our side, it\u2019s impossible to feel alone. Her passion for biology is beyond admirable. She considers each life\u2014from majestic sea creatures to creepy crawlies\u2014her \u201cscrunklies\u201d and has vowed to protect all of them. It\u2019s a joy to watch her explore the world, taking us with her on the journey. Agriculture is also among her passions after the elective ignited a new fire within her. As a multi-faceted person, she also pursues artistic endeavors with gusto. From music to writing to art, she\u2019s done it all and explored each sub-field. She\u2019s created both original and fanwork, and each piece overflows with enthusiasm and inspiration. Of particular note are her poems and original songs, which never fail to evoke profound emotions or create such banger vibes. Not to mention her skill with the guitar, which constantly leaves us in awe as she serenades us with her lilting voice. This isn\u2019t enough to capture how much we love you, Lauren. Regardless, we hope that every day, someone reminds you of how special you are by greeting you, \u201cHappy birthday!\u201d"]

He does his best to contribute to projects, academics or other personal stuff, such as playing drums in a band with his friends. He is a very funny person, strong and independent, but he still asks help from others if he needs to. He's not afraid to do new things, take initiative, and handle anything that life throws at him. From silly anecdotes to long rants, Justin immerses you with his storytelling. He is meticulous and introspective, and his ability to frame even the most dire situations positively is something we could all learn from him. May it be about reqs, anime, or whatever\u2019s going on in life, you would never have a bad time talking to Justin.\r\n\r\nThe first time we met him, we all probably thought, \u201cThis bald guy\u2019s kinda funny!\u201d Jokes aside, Justin is one of the toughest guys his friends know.

It could be that his growth scales directly with the amount of hair he has\u2014somebody\u2019s gotta do research on that. On a more serious note though, he is that reliable friend who\u2019ll stick by your side. He's resilient to life\u2019s adversities and stays positive through everything. Not to mention, he\u2019s a really damn good friend. He\u2019d cringe reading this, doing one of his trademarked Justin walks, eventually just saying the also-trademarked Justin \u201cOkay,\u201d and we\u2019re counting on it.

His presence is calming, and it\u2019s nice to just chill with him. We wish we had more opportunities to get to know him better.

With that, I immediately decided to take the seat beside her when I saw that we were going to be classmates for the first time back in Grade 11, and it is one of those choices I would do over and over again if given the chance. In a year, she became more than just a model I aspire to be; she has become a dear friend I can talk to about the pettiest rants, have unmatchable teamwork dynamics with, and consider as one of my closest persons. I strive to be better the more I get to know her: how vocal she is with what she thinks, how she sets an example of a leader, and how she supports one in every aspect of their life. Perhaps what I admire about her the most is how she continues to dream big despite having achieved a lot already. With the fire she\u2019s always had in her eyes, I believe she will reach the stars, and I will be there to cheer her on as we both conquer the world.", "It is no secret that Andy is an incredibly hardworking person. Since Grade 7, she has already been involved in numerous extracurricular activities; from being a class officer to being the Overall Yearbook Co-Head, you can always rely on her to step into a leadership role. She is reliable and headstrong, managing to overcome any problem she faces. It is admirable that she has the drive to achieve new heights\u2014finding a sense of direction in the endless field we call life."]

He is also the type of friend who goes out of his way to guide you, support you, joke around with you, and make sure you feel heard.

This guy will put up with all of your dumb ideas while adding his own twist to it, making you feel heard and appreciated. Marcus is a really fun guy who does not judge anyone, and combined with his out-of-this-world Math ability and sense of humor, he always is a great companion to have.

Reese is a talented human being, but do not forget about her personality that makes you love her even more. She is caring and sensitive, with a beautiful heart that her friends are proud to be carrying a piece of. Reese will always be by your side to listen and empathize, whether it may be about Ma'am Dinah's class or just everyday chikas. She makes you feel very appreciated; after talking to her, you\u2019d find that any doubts about yourself would have disappeared. Reese has so much love to give, especially to the people in her life and to the little things around her; she is very appreciative towards all the good things that come her way. She deserves the entire world\u2014we hope she knows that because many people love and appreciate her for who she is.", "Reese is known to be an avid reader, which likely explains her incredible talent in writing. She has such a special way with words, an innate ability to describe even the most indescribable things. Her writing invokes such profoundness and emotion, and it reflects the beautiful soul inside. Whether in words or in music, the ways she expresses herself and talks about her favorite things in the world is wonderful. She is definitely a Gryffindor at heart, having Harry\u2019s determination, Ron\u2019s quirks, and Hermione\u2019s intellect in one hooman bean.\r\n\r\nPassion isn\u2019t simply born from interest, but Reese is simply passion personified. Although she\u2019s sometimes reserved, when with her friends, she reveals to be a cheerful and amusing person. It is a delight to be given the opportunity to meet such a bubbly and quirky person! Talking to her is far from boring since she always manages to bring out the best in her friends. With her, you can be your unapologetic self. May her own story unfold as gloriously as she weaves her tales."]

He has a brilliant way with words that fill you with hope and encouragement, but in the moments that he\u2019s lost for words, he will give you the tightest hug or gentlest pat to assure you that you\u2019re not alone. Although he may not be the most social and outspoken person, he has his own way of showing his support and letting you know how loved you are by him. He may not be aware of this, but his unyielding dedication to his dreams and passion for the things he loves inspire us to strive to be better people. He ignites that fire inside you, pushing you to grow and chase after those goals.

He says both insightful and humorous opinions about most things he comes across, and this is what makes him a good friend to have. It\u2019s always nice getting to chat with him. You could walk back and forth for hours talking to him, and not once will you get bored. He\u2019s someone you can find yourself just easily spending time with, having thought-provoking conversations about practically anything. He is an aspiring psychologist, with an interest not only in helping people with mental health struggles but in the way people think in general, and this is something that can easily be felt in discussions with him. Even for those who don\u2019t get to talk with him that much, any conversation either lasts for seconds or more than an hour, no in between. He makes really good company, as he shows interest in your stories while sharing his own. No matter how long we spend with him though, it\u2019s beyond us how we manage to walk away from the conversation seeing something from a different perspective because of him. He\u2019s patient and will not judge you, and you can see how intently he\u2019s listening and trying to understand you. Another thing that we like about him is his ability to show concern and empathy for others. He is the go-to guy when you want someone to listen. Whenever you approach him for help or just want to talk about your problems, he will genuinely listen, give sound advice, and empathize with you. His company is more than just enjoyable, and we\u2019ll definitely be missing it. Von is one of the strongest people we know, and it is admirable how he faces all the challenges that are brought unto him through the years. He\u2019s also a man of faith, serving in the SCA ever since his early years in Pisay. Whenever there\u2019s a mass for an event, it\u2019s certain that he will serve the altar. It also shows in his kindness and empathy towards others that he follows his faith very well. Amen. Some of his friends may have known Von for a very short time, but in that period, his friends can most definitely assure you that he\u2019s one of the coolest guys you\u2019ll ever know. The God of Excel in Physics and the absolute GOAT of billiards and 8 ball. He\u2019s hard working and funny, what more could you ask for? Good luck in life, Efren \u201cBatumbakal\u201d Reyes :)"]

But what did I do? I stood my ground. I knew that I couldn\u2019t just quit after encountering small roadblocks. That would be like mining for some precious gems, only to encounter some inexpensive minerals. What pushed me to persevere were those small milestones that I could consistently keep up with, the Sapphires lining the walls of the cave I tiresomely trudged through, knowing my goal was close at hand.\r\nLike the Champaca flower, it took me time for my mind to flourish, for my mind to find its June to September just like the flower\u2019s carpels. This time I knew I could keep going forward.

The last dance. The long journey\u2019s end. How long will it be? How much longer will we be amongst the environment we grew to appreciate, almost like a second home?

There\u2019s no feline in trouble, just one very troubled Lance. One strange specimen indeed, SCP-6969-R is a harbinger of the most bizarre conversations, brought upon by the most bizarre monologues. If unused to his presence, these conversations may easily drive one insane. However, he bears a striking similarity to fungi, as he quickly grows on any researcher who makes contact with him. For those who have grown attached to him, any conversation with him may cause one to feel giggly and light. This is the first sign that SCP-6969-R has lured you into his clutches. If you are particularly lucky, then you may hear him begin to sing beautifully, further tangling you in his web. As symptoms of SCP-6969-R\u2019s possession progress, you may begin to lean into your inner feral beast and share your own bizarre thoughts. While it may be freeing to release yourself from the confines of social norms, it must be noted that any conversation with him may quickly spiral into absolute chaos.\r\n\r\nScenario KY-500: Chaos is what Lance feeds and thrives on. As maximum capacity for chaos is exceeded, Lance will begin to envelop the world in the same sleepy haze he is known to possess, until the fabric of the time-space continuum itself begins to tear.\r\n\r\nContingency-CAS-5: Ideally, the contingency plan must be carried out in full PPE. Upon seeing him guarding the gazebos, carefully approach him while keeping an eye out for any potential victims. Once he begins to beg you for money to buy clothes or a new PC, bully him relentlessly to maintain and redirect his attention.

His growth these past few years was impressive, we don\u2019t know anyone else who\u2019s done that. He\u2019s always been a good person, but he wasn\u2019t always so honest to himself and we can\u2019t explain how proud and thankful we are that he seems much happier and freer now without letting his drive for life and his passion projects go. We\u2019re glad he got here. It\u2019s always enough where he is, but we know he\u2019ll want to keep walking forward.", "Lance is a cool guy. He likes doing art, coding, and making all sorts of things, and oh boy, does that guy make! From several random projects to his child and baby video game, he makes a lot, including some cute crochets! But he also desires meaning in every little creation, all of them greatly thought-provoking. He has a vivid imagination which often makes his output unique and beautiful, and it is also why he ends up joining a lot of projects with his peers. His passion and dedication to the things he likes is not to be underestimated. Snagging a spot in the Director\u2019s List twice in each quarter for the past 21 years and having won the Nobel Peace Prize in Computerography, he has truly worked hard for all the skills he has and it shines most evidently in everything he draws, types, and writes. His gamer brain is huge, and his joker spleen, which is very serious, is similarly swollen from the insane amounts of comedy fluid inside. He\u2019s fun to hang out with and is usually down for some shenanigans, primarily because of his second spleen\u2014his compassion and friendship spleen. He shall forever live on in our hearts\u2014our dangerously enlarged hearts. Live, laugh, Libatique."]

We can always count on her to get us something whenever she checks out that Shopee cart, even if we don't ask her to. While we tease her that she\u2019s from an angel, Angie is someone we can rely on to listen to our rants and delusions, as ridiculous as they may be. It's hard to imagine an alternate reality where the three of us aren't the Tagbak-girls, so we are grateful to Angie for bringing us together with her Research topic. We have been together since G11, and we will always be partners-in-crime in everything, from impulsive spending sprees to poster-making struggles. We are certain that eleven years from now, we will still remain the Tagbak-girls.

For four minutes and twenty-three seconds, 7-Opal listened keenly as Angie quietly mumbled the song lyrics. We're not even sure if Ma'am Caps, who was sitting right next to her, heard her singing the famous pop ballad. Nevertheless, Angie has noticeably overcome much of her shyness, and that growth is a true testament to her unwavering character. Despite our playful teasing that she might spontaneously combust upon stepping foot inside church, Angie, our sweet little angel (emphasis on \u201clittle\u201d), is anything but a demon. She knows how to match anyone's energy, and that makes her especially fun to talk to about shared interests. When she's dying of laughter, you follow suit because her laugh mimics a motorcycle revving up. Angie is a great listener, too. She'll listen to your gossip and love life stories, and she gives you sound advice whenever you need them. The day will come when we take our final bus ride home together, but the past six years with her have been quite the journey."]

A friend that was there during our lowest points in life. An indecisive man. An aspiring, absolute bioethics, gacha, statsmaxxing and data science nerd. A friend that, despite him thinking otherwise, has made so many people change for the better.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s been there from the start and has never left. Through good times and bad, he\u2019s always had so many interesting things to say and so many experiences and stories to tell. We honestly don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be without him. Even though we keep making fun of each other for being nerds in our respective hobbies, it really feels great knowing someone has a shared passion with us when it comes to talking about video games. This mad lad is the close friend we opened up to during rough times and the friend who saved us from social alienation.\r\n\r\nA 10/10 friend through and through, yet the changes he\u2019s inspired has made many much better people. Good luck out there big guy, you\u2019ll do great. :)"]

Beyond artistic capabilities, she never backs down from any challenges she faces and does her tasks with utmost effort. You won't find a purer soul with a heart as big as Mitch\u2019s. She never forgets to greet anyone with a smile and a wave, showing that she's one of the most genuine people we\u2019ve ever met.

She is a treasure, a confidante, and a beacon of sunshine.", "A beautiful soul, Mitch is admired by many because she is so unapologetically herself, and with this comes a natural charisma. Mitch is incredibly charming and boy, does she know it. With a well-timed wink, she could hype you up with encouraging words or poke fun at you by striking through your soul with emotional damage. Although sometimes, she needs help realizing how talented she really is. Every time Mitch opens her mouth to speak or perform, people would find themselves pausing whatever they were doing and listening to what she has to say. Like Mitch herself, her performances are full of passion and emotion; it has a way of reaching the audience even if she\u2019s onstage and they\u2019re in their seats. She is easy to talk to because she never fails to make anyone feel comfortable when they\u2019re around her. She knows when to cheer you on, but she\u2019ll also make sure to pull you back to Earth and get the ground under your feet again if you need it. She imparts wisdom to the people around her and helps them realize that being scared is normal; it\u2019s how you deal with it that matters in the end. A golden girl with a golden heart, we are thankful to have her in our lives."]

She bullies you, but it\u2019s funny, and it\u2019s her so it\u2019s allowed. When she loves, she capital L Loves, doing her best to ensure that you know how much she cares about you (infinitely), how far she\u2019s willing to go for you (to the ends of the universe and back), and how greatly she trusts you (she\u2019ll send you her passwords). Misha has both emotional diarrhea and emotional constipation somehow. She\u2019s very supportive and is always open to listening to us, whether what we have to say is the most mundane kuwento or the vilest thoughts that a human could have. She\u2019ll stay and be there for you in your lowest of lows, and cheer you on and hype you up at your highest peaks.

In a time where it\u2019s so easy to lose passion for your interests, seeing Misha express her love for Chemistry is a wonderful thing. She\u2019s also an amazing artist, in both her drawings and music. She creates art that has inspired people to start drawing, she knows and expertly plays several instruments, and she arranges music for fun. She puts her all into her work, grinding requirements until 3:00 AM to finish them weeks early and participating in various competitions. She joins advocacy groups and attends protests; conversations with her on social issues are greatly insightful. Granted, her commitment to the things she so passionately works on and for becomes too serious sometimes (hi Misha, yes we\u2019re calling out your overworkedness). Everyone needs a Misha in their lives. And to those who do have Misha Lumibao in their lives, we hope you\u2019re haunted forever by the ever-there whisper of \u201cWhatssup guys it\u2019s msaeng.\u201d"]

His approach in leading committees for major events creates a casual but productive environment. However, he\u2019s not only a person of humor but also of substance and love. David definitely knows his worth and the value of trust. Only few people may know, but David is very sentimental; he highly values friendships. In fact, he brings a polaroid camera on special occasions to keep special memories through photographs! He is also a friend who wouldn\u2019t leave you in your most vulnerable moments; he is a friend we would trust our lives with. David is definitely an inspirational and admirable person to many, and we, as his friends, are beyond lucky to have him."]

His GWA apparently hasn\u2019t dipped below 1.200 (which is just crazy to think about). He\u2019s part of the Chemistry and Informatics team; he\u2019s heir apparent to The Chem Lord and ComSci Lord lineage, with Sir Winner\u2019s blessing to participate in IChO. He also listens to the most obscure jazz bands one has heard of\u2014make of that what you will. Even though he participates in 50 organizations (from PSYSC to being one of the first people who will see this yearbook in whole), Davis is one of the most responsible people we have met. Even in high-pressure team competitions, he can code graph-searching algorithms in five minutes but would balance redox reactions wrong during PACSiklaban. Ironically, he\u2019s one of the most chill people outside of academics, even chilling in the dorm with YouTube videos during hell week, while being very vulnerable to pressure from his friends playing Splendor until midnight. We\u2019ll definitely miss his sarcastic humor, the random BLOB lunches, and banter during Chem Team training. Pero please, magka-jowa ka na :p\r\n\r\n(edit: sheesh)", "Magpantay. An ironic last name for someone who\u2019s a step above the rest. His faithfulness to the grind has allowed him to garner the admiration and respect of many, and his blazing passion for Chemistry has named him heir to the Chem throne. However, his intimidating Great Wall of academic achievement is offset by his easy-going demeanor and modest personality, making him one of the friendliest and most approachable people in the batch. It is in his nature to be careful and sure\u2014except when it comes to girls. Although he\u2019s able to identify complex chemical structures, Davis wouldn\u2019t recognize a flirting attempt even if it exploded in his face. He still has a long trek of life up against him; however, he takes every one of those steps with circumspection. And no matter how many knives are thrown at his back, he manages to move on and still be the Davis we all know and love.\r\n\r\nP.S. The writers acknowledge that Davis is a Yearbook head and ask him not to sue, thank you."]

He\u2019s easily recognizable for his loud and funny side comments during class; he can make a whole room laugh, teachers included. As everyone associates him with jokes and shenanigans, it can be a shock when he comes up with profound and utterly unique takes; he was one of the few in 11-G who thrived in Sir Vlad\u2019s very fun curriculum. Surprisingly, his MBTI states he\u2019s introverted, which is weird for all his loudness, but it makes sense when you realize that he keeps a lot to himself. Instead of sharing his secrets, he mostly listens to those of others; he\u2019s all for the tea, but whenever you\u2019re down, he readily becomes a trustworthy source of comfort and reassurance. He gives solid advice, even if we don\u2019t always listen. Another defining aspect of Zoriel\u2019s character is his ride-or-die loyalty towards people he cares about. He\u2019d literally fight for you if need be. Whether you interact daily or rarely, he\u2019ll make it so that time hasn\u2019t passed much. He might bring up an inside joke or funny instance from long ago to assure you that he still remembers the fun times you\u2019ve had together. That\u2019s yet another defining quality: his creepily extensive memory. Having such a gift is definitely an envy; subjects that use stock knowledge are a breeze to him, and he can keep up with any conversation with the loads of pop culture he knows. He keeps up with the times, but he\u2019s also constant with the things he likes, given his particular aesthetic. His music taste is noticeably curated, with a core of alternative, rock, and alternative rock. OPM is also a big part of it. Just from his Top Artists in this school year\u2019s Spotify Wrapped, you\u2019d find Juan Karlos, Zild, Dilaw, and IV of Spades in that order (and then there\u2019s Arctic Monkeys at #5). Judging from his music, it\u2019s no surprise that his wardrobe is heavily black, but he has recently shown a new goal to try more colors. It\u2019s also no surprise that he\u2019s a horror film buff, but as far as films go, his taste is diverse. He won\u2019t openly say it, so we will\u2014this guy is quite the enjoyer of rom-coms, which is an adorable contrast to his usual vibe. He\u2019s also competitive, which shows when he plays basketball and other games like Valorant. Overall, there\u2019s so much, too much to say about this guy that a 2400-character limit can\u2019t do justice, so this is it for now."]

Being with her is like being in another world with all the stories she shares.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s most admirable about her, though, is her humility. She doesn\u2019t brag about her achievements and still remains as herself: the sweet, kind, and gentle person we know. With her sweet aura, kind gestures, and gentle voice, she makes for one of the best friends ever. She always lends a listening ear and a comforting shoulder to cry on. She can truly brighten up our days just like how the moon brightens up our nights. Even through the years, she remains genuine and confident with herself. We just know that she\u2019ll be successful one day with her diligence and kind spirit. :)"]

Kevin \u201cThe Roy\u201d Navarro, as he was known in the ring, was a kind-hearted and very funny boy. Serving in the trenches and having survived a global pandemic, he learned to bear through bad situations, to make people feel better, and to lift the hearts of his peers with his incredible wit and fearless attitude. He always supported his friends, gave his time and effort, and was definitely the life of many a-party. More importantly, he danced well. He rocked baby rocked. He was also an incredible gamer, being no stranger to Vintaging a Story, Mining a Craft, or Lethaling a Company.\r\n\r\nAs an expert Volanter, he was also active in playing sports such as football and badminton, and in conquering other players during matches in Pisay. However, his excellence in academics should not be forgotten. Though he did believe that the derivative of cosine was sine, he puts great effort into his work nevertheless, and we believe he holds within him great potential capable of achieving great things. As we always say, \u201cHe\u2019s a scholar with the deets and a monster in the spreadsheets.\u201d\r\n\r\nKevin will maybe truly be remembered as one of the legends, and his name to be forever engraved in the annals of history\u2014probably somewhere in the footnotes, followed by an incredible 200-page article memorializing the life and times of the Koko Krunch Bear. Despite challenges, he still manages to live one of the lives of all time, seizing glory with both hands.

Not only is he industrious, but he\u2019s also fun to talk to. You can also approach him about how he arrived at an answer to a question from a Chemistry problem set, and he always somehow explains it so clearly.\n\nOutside of his excellent academics, Ethan is also a person of diverse fascinations.

If you think, however, that he has a book glued to his face 24/7, you may want to think again. Ethan is more than his acads, and you may be shocked to know how relatable he really is. From playing Minecraft, to ordering BonChon, to gossiping about the latest tea, Ethan is fun to be around. After all, he has a sense of humor that is, let\u2019s just say, surprising. Now, Ethan is not only in tune with his friends but also with the Filipino people. He is the epitome of a scholar of the nation, possessing a sharp mind keen in pursuing the untarnished truth and guided by a love for his country, making him ready to stand against injustices; this love for country also extends beyond the Philippines because Ethan loves anything Japan-related as well. Not to mention, we might see Ethan in Japan for college soon!"]

You're gonna learn a lot of things just by being around him. Whatever situation you\u2019re in, Kurt will always be there for you. He has never failed to be a good friend. He\u2019s the kind of guy that would joke about doing something then absolutely dedicate himself into carrying out said joke, like bcc-ing a friend in all his Research-related emails.\r\n\r\nKurt is a dependable go-to-companion for every sponty adventure under the radar. He is always full of stories and chikas. Moreover, he's a great food buddy who is always down to indulge in different culinary delights, may it be kanto food or high-end restaurants. Kurt seamlessly transitions from a car buddy to walk buddy with unmatched energy and that is evident with the number of rants we had. A natural empath, he never fails to lend a compassionate ear in times of need; he is a friend who can effortlessly turn ordinary events into unforgettable moments.

He knows how to have fun with his closest friends, but at the same time, he comes across as one of the most mature people in the room. At the same time, he doesn\u2019t fail to show his appreciation for his relationships, capturing and documenting every single one of our galas.

Even though we\u2019d show no intention of actually playing them ourselves, this does not deter him from geeking out in full detail about lore, graphics, or gameplay. His enthusiasm extends to his own passion projects, which I, Erin, have had the privilege of being among the select few whom he asks advice from (I\u2019m grateful for the trust he places on me). His ability to stay with a project through many revisions and his tendencies towards extensive worldbuilding are a few of the many qualities that make him cool. I am grateful for his friendship, which has survived despite being in different sections and struggling through the pandemic. May his love for art be carried with him even when he\u2019s busy with the hurdles of real life. Wishing him the best!"]

He, in fact, surpasses me in computation-heavy subjects like Math and Economics but not in Chemistry 3 since I still need to stay on top somehow.\r\n\r\nHe is a very fun person to be around for many reasons: we have passive-aggressive but friendly conversations, sympathize together over our terrible experiences in tests and other requirements, and mess with each other's business while helping or supporting on the side. Even though our Grade 12 schedules conflict, he is still a treasured part of my SYP experience; I could not imagine how I would fare in Pisay without him. Overall, he is one of the stars that brightens my thrilling journey here, making it enjoyable and fulfilling.

Andrei\u2019s been flying under the radar for six years due to his introverted personality, but when you get to know him, you\u2019ll realize just how impressive he really is. Looking for an academic achiever? He\u2019s got you. Need a pianist for a band? Look no further! Searching for a gaming buddy? He\u2019ll carry you, no sweat. Want someone to genuinely listen and give advice that is second to none? Andrei\u2019s there. He is not your average person; he thinks through every situation in order to give you the best advice you could receive. He\u2019s one of the most genuine people you\u2019ll ever meet. This music-loving, football-kicking, coffee-drinking genius will steal your heart when you least expect it. Andrei is a man beyond words, literally and figuratively. Even with his timid voice, you find yourself drawing closer to him when he speaks. He\u2019s truly a ride-or-die friend that you\u2019ll want with you no matter the situation \u2026 except when he\u2019s the one driving, then he turns to a ride-and-die friend. Kidding aside, there is no greater comfort than having this guy on your side. That\u2019s our Labuyo president, Andrei Pablico.", "When we think of Andrei, reliability comes to mind. He looks like someone who has everything together, and he usually does, but sometimes, not so much. Some days, he would accidentally snort a grain of rice up his nose (real event). He\u2019d shout at the Labuyo players during club time, but he\u2019d tell us a story and we could barely hear a word because his voice was too soft, but we love that about him. He would always have some gossip or a story to share, and he would always have the time to listen to ours. We can always count on him to give great advice about anything, and he\u2019d always be easy to convince to go with our shenanigans. When we think of Andrei, we remember the time he tried playing Genshin Impact for us which lasted one day. We stayed up until 2 am watching him play, only to never go back to the game and leave us hanging. Despite this, though, his laptop is filled with Genshin stickers (why? char). We think of the time he willingly accepted the punishment of getting soaked in water instead of us during the school fair. In our six years of being close friends, Andrei\u2019s always been someone we can rely on to be there, and we love him like family."]

He smarts at any form of injustice, be it a nation conquered by a foreign power, or an individual wronged by another. He also cares about the environment, amidst unbridled exploitation and destruction by men.\r\nLike his other namesake, the famous leader Moses, Amos is kind of a loner. He sometimes dwells too much on the problems of humanity. He can get frustrated when he can\u2019t figure out the rationale behind his peers\u2019 actions. He generally keeps to himself to maintain peace with his surroundings. He can, however, be loquacious with strangers. At times, he goes out of his way to chat with random people.\r\nLike his third namesake, the biblical priest Aaron, Amos is a good speaker. He does not shy away from public discourse and enjoys performing on stage. He loves language and is interested in learning them. He regrets, however, not giving proper attention to his mother tongue and is working to correct that. He loves his native culture and would like to see it flourish amidst current modernization and globalization."]

When he does genuinely laugh at the silliest and weirdest jokes, it\u2019s contagious and you\u2019ll start seeing everyone else laugh about it too. A lover of Olivia, Taylor, Sabrina, and Madison, his music taste is exquisite and you can always count on him to have solid recommendations on what you should also listen to.\r\nEnzo is also a man of sheer commitment. Whenever he gets into something new, it comes naturally for him to learn, and boy does he automatically do it better. He\u2019ll know how to do everything better than you in the span of a day or two. His exemplary work ethic and commitment to anything he does allows Enzo to be one of the most gifted people you\u2019ll interact with. On the outside, you might think that Enzo is just a pretty quiet, reserved, and mysterious person. He\u2019s not a man of many words in usual situations, but even if that's the case, he doesn\u2019t need to say anything to make his presence felt. As you dig deeper into who he is, there is a unique and bejeweling personality that shines through in the things he does. He\u2019s also like the ocean, appearing still and calm on the surface, but once you break through the exterior, you see the true beauty and depth lying within.\r\nAt the same time, he is the definition of altruistic, always seeing the good in people, and helping others without condition. Most importantly, Enzo is someone who values his relationships with everyone, making him one of the most supportive and reliable friends you could ever have. His patient and caring nature is always felt by the people around him, and he never fails to make others feel loved and accepted for who they are. He also usually knows when you need a hug or a laugh, but he also knows when you just simply need a shoulder to lean on. Beyond his enigmatic impression lies someone genuinely kind, and for that, he is a prized and cherished friend to all. He is truly one of a kind, and he deserves the world for everything that he\u2019s done for everyone else."]

Pen spinning, Celeste, Math, and CompSci are just a few of the skills this man has grinded.

It was seventh grade, around 20:00, and they lost their charger. They tried borrowing from a lot of the people they knew, but the one person who was willing to lend one was Roj. They didn\u2019t even know him at that time, and it was surprising to receive help from someone they didn\u2019t even interact with since they were of different sections and dorm rooms. They are proud to say that his reliability and helpfulness still carries on. With his passion for his acads and hobbies (of which we can\u2019t even imagine being so good on), they carry deep respect for his character.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, he is a caring person whose resilience is one that we truly admire. His presence lights up a ton of fun, and the hard work he puts towards his interests encourages everyone to be better and do better. He has always been someone who we will always appreciate. He\u2019s hardworking, really into the things he enjoys, and very clearly cares a lot about many things. Even after five whole years of knowing him, we still find ourselves seeing new faces and sides of him to this day. Keep your head up, king. You deserve it."]

She is one of a kind, a living epitome of feminism. If I were to describe her in one word (or two), it would be girl boss. Bianca is a powerful and independent woman, who can withstand whatever comes her way. She would be that friend: the friend that will always be there for you through thick and thin; the one you will call when you kiss a stranger. To be honest, she will be that one-call-away friend and it is proven and tested, from that 30-day streak of calling each other every night during the summer to the point that we didn\u2019t have anything to talk about and just sent TikToks to one another. Bianca, my high school life would not be complete without you in it. You made my senior years bearable. And with that, I am beyond grateful that I met you.

You can never predict how he\u2019ll think in certain situations, what he\u2019ll do next, and how he\u2019ll react in conversations, yet that is exactly what makes him fun to be around. The only thing you can predict about him is that after whatever he\u2019s gonna say, you\u2019re gonna wind up on the floor laughing. However, Ramon is much more than his entertaining jokes; he\u2019s genuinely one of the friendliest people you will ever meet. Talking to him will bring out a side of you that you never even knew existed. He has a certain charm that makes you feel at home and say anything around him without judgment. Behind his carefree or nonchalant demeanor, Ramon is actually a friend who can be there to listen to you even during your most vulnerable moments; he can even be a shoulder to cry on (literally, if your head can even reach his shoulder).

Also, he isn\u2019t shy about showing his love for the country. One time, during the Club Fair, he was walking around the 2nd Floor Gym shouting \u201cAktibista, hindi terorista!\u201d among other chants. In that building, his voice was heard by everyone.\r\nThe way that he fights for his advocacies reflects how he also defends his friends and his beliefs when the situation calls for it.

What\u2019s more intriguing though, is his love of law, international relationships, and politics, which enables his capability to cite important sections of the 1987 Constitution. This is all inspired by his passion for public service; he\u2019s not selfish. He campaigned for Leni Robredo to ambivalent voters, bought slippers for students experiencing poverty, and donated all of his hard-earned money to buy alcohol for frontliners during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most importantly, he\u2019s a free spirit. He inspires us to be more adventurous, as we see that his life is never bland. He works hard and dreams big. He sees the potential everyone can hold.

This rings true, even if he\u2019s very goofy, even if he keeps using the same jokes over and over, even if he mansplains about movies and MUN, even if he has a toxic relationship with video editing, and even if he literally never takes off that jacket. These may sound like complaints, but since this is a yearbook write-up, we simply feel obligated to give an accurate idea of the guy. But really, we couldn't be farther from complaining if we tried.

What will appear besides his accounts are statuses featuring not his handsome face (except one, and another of a bronze Chinese-Filipino statue) but rather profile pictures of others he is credited for taking: from as recent as the massive and glamorous Rendezvous Promenade DP blast to as far back as 2019, where he was thanked for his camera below a cheesy pick-up line. But any posts revealing who Nathan Sales actually is? It is the curse of the cameraman. Such a persona extends to who he is in the classroom. One can ask his classmates on who he is and (roughly) eight out of ten times be met with \u201cI do not know him personally.\u201d Do not be misled though; his lack of social remarkability does not equate to his lack of value. An anonymous note of his gracious participation in editing Block B\u2019s entry to this year\u2019s English Radio Drama\u2014their third place finish is arguably a snapshot of his skills. Some vaguely but confidently describe him as a reliable team member. Going out of the classroom \u2026 reveals quite the same vignette. Surprisingly (at least in a casual observer\u2019s perspective), it is easy to presume that Nathan is actually the conversationalist. Occasionally seeing him joke back in Tanay Retreat or talk with his friends in 1F ASTB, one can make the impression that he is funny, agreeable, and chill. But of course, compared to the refined portraits he produced, such images of him can only be fairly treated as blurred jigsaw pieces. They only reveal incomplete illustrations of the actual Nathan Sales. Worse (but oh, the poetic justice), to have a random attempt to elucidate such a mysterious persona aligns to his cameraman\u2019s tragedy. One day, the cameraman shall be generously captured as much as he did others. One day, the world shall know Nathan Sales. And snap."]

He is generally subdued, even proper\u2014the type you would imagine to not participate in loud conversations or common \u201cboys\u2019\u201d horse plays, and rather prefer the sanctuary of books, music, art, and gaming. Stretch this stereotype and even his physical profile checks out. Well, he is spectacled. He dons a hoodie more times than not, scarved with headphones by his neck if they are not geared on his ears, and man, is he quite tall too.\r\n\r\nBut for those fortunate enough to know Yohance beyond these stereotypes, as in the lucky ones who can guiltlessly call themselves his friends, introverted seems not to be his best description.\r\n\r\nFor a select few of them, the most fitting adjective is passionate. They graciously recall his love of video games (one stereotype done right), such as Hearthstone, League of Legends, and Dance Dance Revolution. Others note his love of music (two points), both as a listener and a creator. Rock seems to beat in his pulse, and conversely for his band, he seems to rock the pulse of their beat too by being their drummer. Some more tell of his love of geology and biking, and how they are hobbies that keep his life going.\r\n\r\nBut passion is not just his way of life, it is also his way of working. One remarkable anecdote is how he can go unmotivated for one whole school day if the dismissal offers no interesting events. Then if he has a plan to eat outside, a burst of energy will spawn and allow him to magically finish all tasks at hand. Beyond giving depth to the trope, what makes Yohance interesting is how he subverts it. For instance, one states that despite being shy, he is actually funny. Or that while obviously reserved, he can be rowdy too, with the right people, right place, and right number of glasses.\r\n\r\nThere are infinitely better words and stories to capture the curious character of Yohance. But the fact that a random wrote for him adds to the enigma that only a handful was privileged to pierce through. That is Yohance for you."]

It sends a bunch of shivers down my spine thinking about how different I acted before the pandemic, but alas. As time goes on, you learn how to adapt to your surroundings to know more about the people around you, the subjects being taught, and most importantly, yourself. I've definitely learned about those things from the six years I've been in this school because Pisay\u2019s advanced curriculum will really make sure you know.\r\n\r\nThe multitude of group and class projects during the face-to-face years such as Paskorus and Sayaw ng Dekada were things I never really saw the value of in Grades 7 and 8 because I viewed them as a requirement for a grade. But now, I see those projects as a means to meet new friends and get closer to your class and batchmates. I only truly realized when making jokes about how messy my Research topic proposal is with people I didn't even know, resulting in the legendary Milkfish group (you know who you are) that motivated and shaped me into who I am. It was always funny seeing things go wrong with our presentations (complete two more trials of) and lab work (13%); it\u2019s something I will really miss when entering college.\r\n\r\nNot only did I meet so many new people, but I also did many things I didn't think I'd ever do. Co-leading the episode for Taskmaster was by far the most stressful experience I've ever had in my entire stay in Pisay, but it also gave me the most rewarding feeling and outcome once the full episode was complete after two years of production. I did a lot: volunteering to be a student teacher, completing an entire Research paper from proposal to implementation, performing in several dance and musical numbers, making weapons, and so many more things. While a part of me wishes I did more during my stay, a part of me is also impressed with how many new people I've met and how much I actually ended up doing. Thank you for most things, Pisay."]

However, he definitely knows when to be serious\u2014he is hardworking and takes his academics seriously, which is one of the many reasons why we admire him.Sean is a strong person. He\u2019s been through some tough times, but he\u2019s carried himself so well over the years and has grown into his own person. He has become more vocal and expressive towards others, especially to his close friends. He\u2019s sensitive and accommodating, can read the room, and make you feel seen when it matters the most. Sure, he might throw in that sarcastic tone, but trust that it's just his unique way of letting you in on what he really thinks about you. It's like his personal language of honesty, laced with humor.\r\n\r\nTo his friends, he\u2019s been a great support system and constant. He would also always ask his friends when he notices that they are not in a good state or mood. He can either go from saying the most random, funniest things to having the most genuine talks.", "Fair-skinned, Chinito, and tall\u2014Sean perfectly fits the beauty standards that the masses wish for. If each admirer of his were a song, they would easily outnumber Le Sserafim\u2019s whole discography. Sean may come off as timid or unapproachable, but a simple high-five would instantly dissolve the allegations, revealing his quirky and warm personality. You could often see him strolling around Kalachuchi Lane, and no doubt that he would go to you and ask what\u2019s up. He always checks up on his friends and makes sure everyone\u2019s vibing it out. Whether it be chit-chat about the newest K-Pop hits and chika or deep talks requiring a lap around the field, he\u2019ll always find a way to make you feel seen. His quick jokes paired with genuine concern unveil a side of vulnerability that comes from the heart. Whether it be through his complicated Brawlhalla combos, building a better Minecraft base, working on a better physique, or his ability to tackle all three cores in his SYP life, Sean always strives to improve himself through proper hard work. His persistence is certainly admirable, and he truly embodies perseverance and determination."]

He works in the background, many times unseen, unrecognized, in various events, yet his influence proves great and not to be underestimated\u2014his music! You hear his unholy notes!

Don\u2019t you remember those times, playing simple card games with him, hanging out at parties? He even invited you out to watch a movie once, wasn\u2019t that nice?\r\nWhy had you ever felt such fear, when these fond memories feel so true? Truer than anything you\u2019ve felt before. Its voice is but a whisper but the implications are deafening. The eyes and ears are not the windows to the soul, they are the doors, and be wary of what you admit in. He has already feasted upon your mind\u2014in all your memories he is ever present. Imagine a day, even the smallest, most fleeting moment without him and his cold dreadful gaze. It is impossible. He is toying with his food, and you are playing along. Hahahahaha! You begin laughing to yourself as he grows now to his full height\u2014his shadow feeling most oppressive upon your form.

Bro doesn\u2019t care about his grades, yet he gets unos left, right, and center. Being part of every core and elective and becoming the phantom fourth Res groupmate of essentially every group shows his curiosity, selflessness, and hard work. Bro would casually read Chem books during the break as a hobby. If he joined IChO, he would have easily swept the competition.

When he cooks meals for his kids, he pours so much love into all of them, straight from his ever-loving heart. Out of all the competitions he was in or could have been part of, the contest he would so easily win is a Mom of the Century contest. It wouldn\u2019t even be a contest\u2014that\u2019s how great he is.

"Writeups": ["If there is someone with the right amount of formality and informality, that person would be Jason. People\u2019s first impression of him is seeing him as a serious and polite person, but don\u2019t be fooled by how formal or intimidating he might seem\u2014he can crack jokes at the best times. His humor and antics make any dreary situation something to laugh about, so much that you start looking forward to moments with him. It\u2019s nice to be with him, especially with all of the banter and jokes we share with each other. He is also very accommodating and supportive in all of the things his friends do, whether it be in conversations or in performances with Himig Agham. His interest in intriguing topics like psychology and philosophy also makes him a very wonderful person to talk to. Jason is earnest and responsible, someone you can fully trust with any matter. At the same time, he is relatable and engaging, someone you can talk with for hours about anything under the sun. These reasons, and more, are what make him Jason, and we couldn\u2019t love him more for them.", "Martial arts dude, singer, Chemistry lover-hater, exchange program guru, chronic workaholic\u2014these are the many faces I have shown in my Pisay life. From hanging out with friends and cramming projects to the many exchange programs, countless hours in the lab, and many more extracurriculars I joined that I believed would spice up my high school experience, I have to say that it was even better than I had anticipated. I had decided to enter Pisay only because I felt enticed by the many opportunities here (and the stipend). Looking back at it now, I can see that it has become the catalyst that allowed me to experience enjoyable learning experiences, painful struggles, and an innumerable amount of regrets. But regardless of the pain, hardship, and solitude on my path, I swore to press forward for others to find refuge and healing with me, just as the etymology of my name suggests. I believe I did my best in learning the knowledge and strength I needed to go down such a path."]
