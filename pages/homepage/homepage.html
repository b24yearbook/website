                    It all started with the Big Bang. From there, countless stars poured out and spread to tell their stories. Where will the tales woven among the stars be marked in history? Welcome to Luminare, Batch 2024's yearbook, here to tell you the narrative of the twinkling stars that dot the night sky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It seems like only yesterday that we walked down the school corridors with a spark of curiosity and a passion for knowledge, yet six years passed since we first entered what has become our second home. We made friends and laughed, cried, and achieved great things with them. Through the ups and downs of high school, we clung to each other for comfort and familiarity in a volatile environment. Now, we are leaving for college, preparing to travel through the ever-expanding universe. Although we are moving farther apart from each other, we'll stay connected through our shared high school experiences immortalized in this yearbook. Just as there are countless numbers of stars in the night sky, innumerable too are the memories we shared in a place we once called home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the six years we spent in our own nebula, there were stars that were already shining brightly alongside us - we all know them as our beloved teachers, parents, and school staff. They served as our guiding light throughout our high school years, nurturing and encouraging us to be hardworking students and kind-hearted people. In return, Batch 2024 expresses our deepest gratitude for their guidance and promises to cherish all the advice and life lessons they have imparted to us.
                </p>
